        "\n",
        "Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern.\n",
        "\n",
        "The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Business Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "The business objective for bike sharing demand prediction is to accurately predict the demand for bike rentals in a given area, at a given time, in order to optimize the allocation of bikes and ensure an adequate supply for customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "This can help improve operational efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth."
